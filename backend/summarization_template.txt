text: I can understand that you might be worried that we’re not doing enough, but  I don’t think there is anything to be gained from implementing a whole chat app. I‘d start with implementing the voice message component and if we feel like that was too easy we can always add more. But even then I think our resources are better spent on refining the voice message component than on creating another chat app thats just like all the others that are already existing
summary: I think we should focus on refining the voice message component. I don't think there is a benefit from implementing a whole chat app.
