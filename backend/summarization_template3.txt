summary: programming a voice message component is enough

text: I can understand that you might be worried that we’re not doing enough, but  I don’t think there is anything to be gained from implementing a whole chat app. I‘d start with implementing the voice message component and if we feel like that was too easy we can always add more. But even then I think our resources are better spent on refining the voice message component than on creating another chat app thats just like all the others that are already existing
summary: I think we should focus on refining the voice message component. If that is still not enough, we can add more stuff!

text: Good morning, how are you today? I have to say, I'm pretty tired, because i slept very bad. My back hurts and my head, too. I always have that, when the weather changes.  I should go running today, maybe it makes me feel better afterwards. University will be very hard today, I have 5 lectures and don't know, how to concentrate for this long time! Wish me luck for my day.
